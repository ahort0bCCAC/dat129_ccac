# FINAL PROJECT

## Social Security Administration Names database.

The Social Security Adminsitration has name, gender and occurences* data available for each year of birth after 1879.
This data is available in .txt files as national data (one file per year), state data (one file per state), and teritory data (one file per teritory).
I have chosen to work with national data for this project.  *To safeguard privacy, the SSA restricts the list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences.

In 140 years, only 19 unique names rose to the top each year, eleven unique names among females and eight among males. Although Mary held the top spot the most often at 76 years, in overall occurences Mary ranked #6. Tied for second most often at number one, John and Michael each held the top spot in 44 years.
