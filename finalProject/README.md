## Social Security Administration Names database.
'''
https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
The Social Security Adminsitration has available for download name, gender and head count* data per year starting with 1880.
This data is available for download as a zip file with one .txt file per year when downloading national data, state data, and teritory data.
I have chosen to work with national data for this project.  *"To safeguard privacy, we restrict our list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences."
