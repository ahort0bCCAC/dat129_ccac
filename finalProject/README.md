# FINAL PROJECT

## Social Security Administration Names database.

https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
The Social Security Adminsitration has name, gender and occurences* data available for each year of birth after 1879.
This data is available in .txt files as national data (one file per year), state data (one file per state), and teritory data (one file per teritory).
I have chosen to work with national data for this project.  *To safeguard privacy, the SSA restricts the list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences.
